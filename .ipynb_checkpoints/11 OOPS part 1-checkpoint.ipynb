    "OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in Python is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design and build applications. It helps in organizing code by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. Python, as an object-oriented language, supports OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Here's a breakdown of these key concepts:"
